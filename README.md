# Progression-Outcome-Prediction
This is a coursework project for predicting academic progression outcomes for university students using Python. The program prompts for the number of credits at pass, defer, and fail and displays the appropriate progression outcome for an individual student. 

The project has four parts:
- Part 1: Outcomes
- Part 2: List (extension)
- Part 3: Text File (extension)
- Part 4: Dictionary (separate program)

To run the program, open the Python interpreter and execute the main Python file. The program will prompt you for input, and you can follow the instructions provided to enter the required data.

The program uses user-defined functions and descriptive names for variables and functions. It also has error handling to display appropriate error messages if a credit input is the wrong data type, credits entered are out of range, or the total of the pass, defer, and fail credits is not 120.

The program also efficiently uses conditional statements and loops to allow a staff member to predict progression outcomes for multiple students. At the end of the program run, it produces a histogram where each star represents a student who achieved a progress outcome in the category range: progress, trailing, module retriever, and exclude.
